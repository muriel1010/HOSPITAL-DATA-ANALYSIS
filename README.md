# 🏥 Health Data Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview
This project explores a synthetic health dataset of 8,000 patients to uncover patterns in disease prevalence, treatment outcomes, hospitalization durations, and mortality risks. The goal is to derive actionable insights for healthcare providers and public health decision-makers using exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques.

---

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Identify the most commonly diagnosed diseases.
- Explore the relationship between gender and disease prevalence.
- Analyze patient stay durations and categorize hospitalization lengths.
- Detect high-risk factors associated with recorded causes of death.
- Assess overall patient outcomes (recovered, deceased, under treatment).
- Present findings using clear and engaging visualizations.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data analysis and visualization
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Charts and plots
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Exploratory coding and documentation

---

## 📁 Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following fields:
- `Patient ID`, `Gender`, `Age`
- `Disease`, `Admission Date`, `Discharge Date`
- `Treatment Status`, `Cause of Death` (if any)

---

## 📈 Key Findings

### 1. Most Commonly Diagnosed Diseases
Malaria, Tuberculosis, and Asthma were among the top diagnosed diseases, with **Malaria** showing the highest frequency.

### 2. Gender-wise Disease Trends
Across all diseases, **males consistently exhibited higher diagnosis counts** compared to females — particularly for Malaria, Tuberculosis, and Asthma.

### 3. Hospital Stay Duration Patterns
Patients were grouped into buckets based on their hospital stay:
- **Above 21 Days** was the largest group, indicating many patients required extended care.
- Very few patients were discharged on the same day.

### 4. Top Causes of Death
Among deceased patients, the most reported causes were:
- Multiple Organ Failure
- Respiratory Failure
- Cardiac Arrest
- Septic Shock

### 5. Patient Outcomes
Out of 8,000 patients:
- ✅ **Recovered**: 85.24%
- ❌ **Deceased**: 5.24%
- 🔄 **Still Under Treatment**: 9.53%

These insights were visualized using a **donut chart** to clearly convey outcome distributions.

---

## 📊 Visualizations
The analysis includes:
- 📊 **Bar Charts**: Disease frequency and gender distribution
- 📋 **Stacked Tables**: Gender-specific disease occurrences
- 🍩 **Donut Charts**: Treatment outcome proportions
- 🏥 **Grouped Histograms**: Patient stay durations

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive overview of disease prevalence, gender-based analysis, risk patterns, and treatment outcomes. The findings can support hospital administration in resource planning, public health monitoring, and patient care strategies.

---

## 📌 Future Work
- Predictive modeling for patient risk assessment
- Time series analysis on admission trends
- Geo-based mapping (if location data is added)
